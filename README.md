### Ansible project
In order to start functioning in ansible world I created simple project involving backend written in C# and provided in ASP.NET Core API - for .NET 8, as for frontend there is react application. Bot can communicate with or without SSL protocol. Ansible is really tool to work with, especially if process can be reached with already built modules in default what enhances work. This project invokes app directly without contenerization, this way educational operations can be amplified. However instruments such as docker would produce result in faster time and in better organized manner, apps lays behind container layer what reduces using extra ordinary procedures.
